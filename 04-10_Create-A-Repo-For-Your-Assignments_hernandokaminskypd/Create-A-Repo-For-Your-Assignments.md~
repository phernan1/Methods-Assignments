This exercise is designed to get you more familiar with the use of git and GitHub. 

0. Login to your GitHub account and create an empty repository named `Methods-Assignments` (do not even let GitHub create a README file); notice the instructions for creating a local repo

0. Create a directory in your ~/Dropbox folder `[droot]/git/Methods/Assignments` (remember that [droot] stands for your Dropbox root, /home/methods/Dropbox)

0. Write a bash script that:
   0. Follows the instructions you should have seen on GitHub to turn `[droot]/git/Methods/Assignments` into a local repository containing a README.md file 
   0. Connects that local `Assignments` repo to your remote `Methods-Assignments` repo
   0. adds and commits the README.md file to your local repo
   0. pushes the local repo to the connected remote repo
   0. Copies your solutions for the assignments for week 3 into the `Assignments` directory
      * This will be the same as the contents of the directory you will have copied from your `/pri` to your `/shr` path
   0. adds, commits, and pushes those solutions to the remote directory
   
0. Once you have done all of this, invite `ccarrollATjhuecon` to be a collaborator on your repo

0. As usual, put any comments into [this-file-name]_[Moniker].md in this directory, so that when you are ready to share this week's solutions (for now, only via the usual Dropbox channel) those comments will be part of the posting
