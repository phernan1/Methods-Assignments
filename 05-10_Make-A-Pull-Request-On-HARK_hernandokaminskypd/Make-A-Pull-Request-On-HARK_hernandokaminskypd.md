This assignment requires you to download the HARK repo on your VM, and to start trying to use it in some way.  
Done [PDHK]

Your assignment is to:

0. Keep exploring the repo until you get to a point where you find something that is puzzling to you, but which upon further thought you manage to figure out.  
Was not able to do. Didn't understand much of the code. Parts that I did understand were trivial, such as making a variable. [PDHK]
0. When you find such a thing, construct an improved version of whatever document or resource it is that first confused you and, when your proposed revision is ready, issue a "pull request" to ccarrollATjhuecon to incorporate your improved version  
Did not do because I was unable to do part 1. [PDHK]
