This assignment requires you to download the HARK repo on your VM, and to start trying to use it in some way.

Your assignment is to:

0. Keep exploring the repo until you get to a point where you find something that is puzzling to you, but which upon further thought you manage to figure out.
0. When you find such a thing, construct an improved version of whatever document or resource it is that first confused you and, when your proposed revision is ready, issue a "pull request" to ccarrollATjhuecon to incorporate your improved version
